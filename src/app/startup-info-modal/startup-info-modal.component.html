  <p [ngClass]="darkMode ? 'text-darktheme-dp-4': 'text-classictheme-dp-4'" class="mt-3">
    Port State Controls are based on an international agreement, which allows port authorities to inspect incoming ships at any time, identify deficiencies
    and, in worst case, even reserve the right to detain it if the deficiencies are considered critical.

    The whole application, both backend and frontend, was development by myself.
    To prevent leaking company sensitive information, this version is slightly modified.
    All the data you are going to see is generated by client side mocks.
    However the demo still contains my current companies logo since its an essential element of the app (opens the navigation bar).
    The source code is available on my <a href="https://github.com/int0x81/PSCPreventDemo" style="color: #0099ee;">GitHub</a> page (frontend part only!).
